# WorldWise

A React Project to practice (React Router, context API, memo, useMemo, useCallback).

WorldWise is a travel tracking app that empowers users to document their global adventures. Key features include interactive map-based location tracking, date selection, and trip note-taking. Users can view a summary of the countries they've visited.

During this project, I did:
- Developed a highly interactive and responsive front-end using React.js and utilized React Router for seamless navigation.
- Employed Context API to manage state, ensuring real-time updates and efficient data handling.
- Enabled user-friendly adventure customization with real-time location selection and note-taking.
- Designed a precise and user-friendly adventure tracking process, and implemented features for viewing summaries of traveled countries.
